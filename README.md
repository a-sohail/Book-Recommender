This project is a book recommender with a GUI that allows users to create an account, where they can rate a selection of 55 books. Based upon their ratings and other users ratings (in terms of similarity), the user can get a list of recommended books that they would like.

Future Improvements: 
- Create better algorithm for recommending relevant books
- Modularize back-end code to avoid cluttering and improve cohesion
- Abstract certain methods away to avoid repeat code
