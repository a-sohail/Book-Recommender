This is a project I mad in ICS4U. 

It is a book recommender with a GUI that allows users to create an account, where they can rate a selection of 55 books. Based upon their ratings and other users ratings (in terms of similarity), the user can get a list of recommended books that they would like.

This project has lot's of room for improvement.
